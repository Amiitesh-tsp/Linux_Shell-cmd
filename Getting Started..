First, When you start operating into a linux system, there is a very popular word so called Terminal. Now, There are different ways of referring to the terminal.
They call it terminal, prompt or the command prompt, the bash shell, the linux shell, etc... The more you use it, the more you get used to it.
So there are different ways of opening the shell.
    1. Press windows key, and then search command prompt/terminal/shell to open it.
    2. Or use the shortcut which I use everyday: Ctrl+Alt+T
After doing so you'll have the shell opened in your computer. To enlarge the shell use the shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+"+"
