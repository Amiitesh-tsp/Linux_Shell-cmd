First, When you start operating into a linux system, there is a very popular word so called Terminal. Now, There are different ways of referring to the terminal.
They call it terminal, prompt or the command prompt, the bash shell, the linux shell, etc... The more you use it, the more you get used to it.
How to open it:
So there are different ways of opening the shell.
    1. Press windows key, and then search command prompt/terminal/shell to open it.
    2. Or use the shortcut which I use everyday: Ctrl+Alt+T

After doing so you'll have the shell opened in your computer. To enlarge the shell use the shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+"+"
Now, getting into the commands used in the shell.
An important point to remember that the shell is strictly typed meaning it is case-sensitive (Just like Python).

Now, as you get to learn different types of commands make sure to execute and test them so that it'll get used to your practical knowledge.
1. The first command:

    pwd

    This will return the directory you are working in. For example, (Documents, Downloads, Music, etc...)
    Now, it stands for print working directory. Make sure to keep checking the directory since you might make the changes in the wrong directory which is going to lead you into a hectic problem.

Now that we have seen how to see the current directory, let's see how to change directories within the shell.
2. Change directory:

    cd

    This command has to be used with 0 or 1 argument. 

    cd <directory_name>

    Now, type in and see "cd Downloads" and then use "pwd" to check the current directory.
    To return to the same default directory, that is, home type in: **cd**
